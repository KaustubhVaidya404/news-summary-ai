## Project Setup

### Prerequisites

- python3
- required packages will be downloaded directly from requirements.txt

### Installation

Step-by-step instructions for setting up the project locally.

```bash
# Create virtual environment
py -m venv [whatever name you want]

# Chage directory to environment
cd [environment directory which you created]

# Start the environment
# Below example is with respect to windows
.\Script\activate

# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/KaustubhVaidya404/news-summary-ai.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd news-summary-ai

# Install the dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the Application

Below are the instructions for running the Application

```bash
# To run the stremlit locally
streamlit run \app.py

# To run the fast api server
fastapi run .\api.py
```

Stremlit runs on post 8501 and fast api server runs on port 8000

## Model Details

### Summarization Model
The summarization model used in this project is based on frequency-based sentence scoring, which is a statistical approach for text summarization. This method does not involve a neural network architecture like transformers; instead, it relies on the following steps:
- Tokenization: The entire content from the articles is tokenized into sentences and words using NLTK's sent_tokenize and word_tokenize functions.
- Word Frequency Calculation: For each word in the content, its frequency is computed. Words are converted to lowercase to ensure case insensitivity, and non-alphabetical words are excluded from the frequency count.
- Normalization of Word Frequencies: The word frequencies are normalized by dividing each word's frequency by the maximum frequency observed in the text. This helps scale the frequency values between 0 and 1.
- Sentence Scoring: Each sentence is scored based on the sum of normalized frequencies of the words it contains. Sentences with higher total scores are considered more important.
- Summary Generation: The top-scoring sentences are selected to form the overall summary. By default, the top 2 sentences with the highest scores are chosen as the summary.
> Libraries Used:
- NLTK: Tokenization of sentences and words is handled using the NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) library.

### Sentiment Analysis Model
The sentiment analysis model is powered by VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner), which is a lexicon and rule-based sentiment analysis tool specifically tuned for social media texts but also effective on other types of text.
- VADER Sentiment Intensity Analyzer: This model is provided by NLTK and calculates a sentiment score for each sentence based on lexical features. It returns a dictionary containing the following values:
    - positive: Probability that the sentence expresses a positive sentiment.
    - neutral: Probability that the sentence is neutral.
    - negative: Probability that the sentence conveys a negative sentiment.
    - compound: A normalized compound score summarizing the overall sentiment of the text, ranging from -1 (extremely negative) to +1 (extremely positive).
- Tokenization: The text from the articles is concatenated (title + summary), and the VADER model analyzes the sentiment of the combined text for each article.
- Training Data: The VADER model is trained on a combination of datasets including general-purpose lexicons as well as human-annotated datasets. It does not require specific training on a custom dataset for this use case and can be applied out-of-the-box.
> Libraries Used:
- NLTK: NLTK's VADER module is used to compute the sentiment scores.

### Text-to-Speech (TTS)
- The Text-to-Speech (TTS) model used in this project leverages Google Text-to-Speech (gTTS) and a translation service to convert English text into Hindi speech. This model works in the following steps:
- Translation: The input text (in English) is first translated into Hindi using the Translator class from the translate library. The translated text serves as the input for generating the speech.
- Text-to-Speech Conversion: The translated Hindi text is passed to Google Text-to-Speech (gTTS), which generates the audio data in Hindi. The gTTS library uses Googleâ€™s TTS engine to synthesize speech from the translated text.
- Audio Buffering: The synthesized speech is written to a buffer (BytesIO) to facilitate easy manipulation and transmission of the generated audio file. This allows for in-memory storage of the audio data.
- Supported Language: The TTS model currently supports Hindi (lang='hi') as the target language for speech generation. However, it can be adapted to other languages supported by the gTTS library by changing the language code.
> Libraries Used:
- gTTS: Used for text-to-speech conversion, supports multiple languages.
- translate: Used for translating the input text from English to Hindi.
- BytesIO: Used to store the audio data in-memory before returning it as a binary stream.

## API Development

#### Accessing API

To access get the data from api

```bash
# To get response
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8000/v1/company?q=YourCompanyName" -H "accept: application/json"
```
```bash
# To get only the desired response i.e only positive or negative or neutral
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8000/v1/company?q=YourCompanyName&sentiment_type=positive" -H "accept: application/json"
```
```bash
# Replace the filename with file name you received to download the audio file
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8000/v1/company/audio/filename" -H "accept: application/json"
```

To access the api docs

```bash
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8000/docs" -H "accept: application/json"
```

## Assumptions & Limitations

### Assumptions

- User will enter company name.
- Language used for input is english only.


### Limitations

- It also scraps information if input is other than company name.
- Cannot generate speech only on summary due to gtts token limitations.
